'''An implementation of a file storage engine
...

Classes
-------
FileStorage
    manages persistence of objects
    by serializing and saving them in a file
'''

import os
import json


class FileStorage:
    '''A storage engine that stores and retrieves
    objects from a file
    ...

    Attributes
    ----------
    __file_path: str
        a private attribute that stores that file path
    __objects: dict
        dictionary that stores all objects by using
        <class name>.id as key. ``id`` is object id

    Methods
    -------
    all():
        returns the dictionary __objects
    new(obj):
        sets in __objects the obj with key
        <obj class name>.id
    save():
        serializes __objects to the JSON file
        (path: __file_path)
    reload():
        deserializes the JSON file to __objects (only if
        the JSON file (__file_path) exists ; otherwise, do
        nothing. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, no exception
        should be raised)
